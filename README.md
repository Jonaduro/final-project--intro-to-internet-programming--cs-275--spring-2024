# Spring 2024 Intro to Internet Programming — Final Project

* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**
* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**

---

## ❖・Introduction・❖

Create a *single* web page consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that prompts the user for the size of a matrix, then prints the matrix with values from 1–user input, then prints the matrix in reverse. The cells in the matrix along the diagonal from top right to bottom left should not be moved, since this is the axis along which the matrix will be reversed, or flipped. A visual of what the matrix should look like is available [here](http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/flipping-a-matrix-along-a-diagonal.mp4).

*You may **only** work within the confines of the included scaffold.*

## ❖・Rules・❖

Before you begin, **update Node, NPM, ESLint, and Stylelint**

### General

* Do not include images in this project
* Do not alter the scaffold of this project, especially the `.gitignore` files
* Ensure your editor is configured to use the enclosed `.editorconfig` file

### HTML

* Place *all* your markup in `dev/html/index.html`

### CSS

* No CSS libraries may be used
* Place *all* your styles in `dev/css/style.css`

### JavaScript

* No JavaScript libraries may be used
* Place *all* your JavaScript in `dev/js/app.js`
* No ESLint errors, except warnings for line lengths
* Use backticks exclusively for all variable interpolation and string manipulation. Should you need to defeat this rule, explain so in a comment
* No function hoisting; only arrow functions. Should you need to defeat this rule, explain so in a comment
* No variable hoisting; only `let` declarations. Should you need to defeat this rule, explain so in a comment
* Use `window.prompt` to take input in from the user
* Create a sentinel-based entry into this program that only allows integers greater than 1
* Use `parseInt` to verify integer input
* Use `Promises` to achieve a correct ordering of the callback function sequence

### Task Running with Gulp

You must employ Gulp as your task runner, with workflows for development and production, identical to assignment 3. Running `gulp` should invoke the development track; running `gulp build` should invoke the production track.
